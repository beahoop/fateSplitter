# 🔮 Fate Splitter

> Your mystical, no-nonsense decision-maker.

Fate Splitter is a playful React Native app (built with Expo) that helps you choose between two options when you're feeling indecisive — like flipping a coin, but sassier and far more dramatic.

Whether you're stuck between tacos or sushi, quitting your job or ghosting your ex, Fate Splitter is here to intervene with sparkles, flair, and the occasional cosmic nudge.
